# TMX2Atlas

## Limitations
* Nothing currently works. Under development!
* External tilesets are not currently supported. You can import an external tileset by selecting it in the Tilesets panel and clicking the "Import Tileset" button in the bottom left.
* Embedded tileset images are not currently supported. I can't for the life of me figure out how to get TiledQT to embed images, so I can't test it.
* Tile-flipping is not supportted.
